    "The date and timestamp for the line in a given csv file is only added after the new line key is pressed. Hence the date and time on a line actually refers to the date and time from the previous line. Due to this the columns are shifted down by two in this function. This is easier than shifting the datetime itself since it has become the index column when importing the csv file for ease of process later in the program. Shifting the index can cause issues and is more complex than simply shifting the rest of the columns. The reason the lines are shifted by two is to get out of the long term logging behaviour which can lead to large time deltas, so this ensures the logger is actually acting in short term mode."

    "Plotly is a graphing library which allows interactive plots to be generated. These plots can be saved to a plotly account and then exported to html or just an image if desired. Plots can be fully customised as desired using the key and value arguments in the dictionaries. For example the title key can be changed. Additionally under xaxis and yaxis is another dictionary where various parameters can be added such as font or size. A demonstatration for customising the axes can be found at https://plot.ly/python/axes/#set-and-style-axes-title-labels-and-ticks which should cover most customisation requirements. Additionally the full reference can be found at: https://plot.ly/python/reference/"
